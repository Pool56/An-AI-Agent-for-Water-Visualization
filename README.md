## Project summary
Public water management agencies face increasing pressure to deliver clean, safe and reliable water amid growing urban populations, aging infrastructure, environmental instability and limited operational budgets. Traditional water monitoring and infrastructure management systems are often fragmented, reactive, and labor-intensive, lacking the real-time visibility and automation necessary for modern utility challenges.
Moreover, there are water engineers who are either visually impaired or due to age are partially  and have difficulty using software such as Microsoft Fabric due to limited vision



### The issue we are hoping to solve
Issues being solved  include for water engineers:

1. Inability to continuously monitor and respond to environmental threats such as seismic activity and temperature fluctuations.

2. Limited visibility into internal water quality factors such as salinity, which affect treatment efficiency and public health.

3. Poor inventory tracking of critical infrastructure such as pipelines, valves, and treatment units, leading to maintenance delays and asset loss.

4. High dependence on manual processes for analysis, reporting, and application development, which reduces operational agility.

Another issue being solved for water engineers with limited vision who struggle to read most of the text that is placed on the software.

### How our technology solution can help
Our technology helps water engineers to effectively evaluate factors that could undermine performance of infrastructure used in a water industry.

Moreover, our solution ensures that the visually impaired are able to access software such as Microsoft Copilot or Microsoft Fabric  through use of plastic braille material.  


### Our idea

To address these problems, we have formulated an  AI- agent that unifies real-time monitoring (through use of Microsoft Fabric), three-dimensional simulation and agile application development. 
We are using Microsoft Fabric and Microsoft Copilot together with data obtained from Internet of Things sensors that are placed in water infrastructure such as in pipes.
So as to refine the data obtained from Internet of Things sensors we are using three-dimensional software such as NX software from Siemens and Autocard.




## Technology implementation

### Microsoft services used
Microsoft Copilot
Microsoft Copilot empowers utility staff and engineers to create custom applications, automate tasks, and generate insights without deep technical expertise.
Key Applications of Copilot in Water Management:
Task Automation:

Automatically summarize incoming data from sensors or reports.

Generate real-time incident response plans based on external environmental data.

Auto-generate email alerts, maintenance schedules, and compliance documentation.

App Development:

Use natural language to design low-code apps for field engineers to log equipment status or perform site inspections.

Build user interfaces for asset tracking, predictive maintenance, or leak reporting with Copilot in Power Apps.

Create chatbots for internal teams to quickly retrieve infrastructure data or environmental conditions.

Integration with Fabric:

Connect Copilot-developed apps to Fabricâ€™s Lakehouse, Real-Time Analytics, or Power BI workspaces.

Use AI to suggest data model improvements, KPI formulas, or visualization strategies.

Microsoft Fabric 

Leveraging Microsoft Fabric Event Analytics for Real-Time Monitoring and Management
Microsoft Fabric provides a unified data platform that supports real-time analytics, large-scale data integration, and intelligent infrastructure monitoring through the following components:

1. Real-Time Intelligence for External Environmental Monitoring
Use Case:
Monitor and react to seismic activities (via Richter scale) and temperature shifts that may affect pipeline integrity or water supply stability.

Functionality:

Real-Time Intelligence connects to sensor feeds via IoT Hub or Event Hub.

Enables rule-based monitoring (such as ground motion exceeding threshold) with alerts.

Supports visualization in Power BI for fast decision-making.

Value:
Improves disaster readiness and infrastructure risk awareness.

2. Event Stream for Internal Condition Monitoring ( such as salinity)
Use Case:
Continuously analyze salinity levels within pipelines or reservoirs to ensure compliance and operational quality.

Functionality:

Event Stream captures real-time readings from internal water quality sensors.

Performs transformations such as filtering, enrichment, and routing to Lakehouse for deep analytics.

Enables triggers when thresholds are crossed.

Value:
Supports dynamic water treatment optimization and early anomaly detection.

3. Dataflow Gen2 for Infrastructure Inventory Management
Use Case:
Maintain up-to-date records of pipes, fittings, and facility components across the water network.

Functionality:

Automates ingestion and transformation of asset data from spreadsheets, ERP systems, or operational logs.

Cleans, enriches, and stores the inventory in a structured format ( such as  Lakehouse tables).

Feeds Power BI dashboards with asset lifecycle, maintenance status, and risk factors.

**Importance of software used**

- [ Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION
-  Microsoft Copilot was used to create AI agents which function as  assistants especially the agent where an activity map was used to examine accuracy of responses.
-  Microsoft Copilot was  used to generate code by use of C# programming language
- Microsoft Copilot was also used to automate tasks by use of flows which a sequence of actions were triggered based on certain conditions

- [Microsoft Fabric]( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION
- Streamlines asset management and minimizes downtime due to untracked infrastructure.

- [Azure AI Playground](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-openai-service-proxy/playground/) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION
- The Azure AI playground was used as an alternative for performing computations for analysis of mechanical components of pumps as well as designing of braille material.
